The Arlington Ladies were the initial volunteer women’s group to attend Veteran’s
interments at Arlington National Cemetery in 1948. Following this model, three other
women’s organizations currently perform similar volunteer services among the 155

The Saratoga Ladies was established in 2022 and is the fifth independent women’s
organization in the United States to perform these services, home-based at Saratoga
National Cemetery.`
